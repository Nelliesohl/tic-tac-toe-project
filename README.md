# Think-Tac-Toe: The developmental values of the game with a brain

The rationale for this project was to create a fun Tic-Tac-Toe game for children, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. By encouraging logical thinking, Tic-Tac-Toe helps children develop their spatial skills. This skill is important for their problem solving abilities â€” from everyday simple chores to complex mathematical equations

Users will go up against the computer in a classical game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a tie, making Tic-Tac-Toe a futile game that's been played and enjoyed for centuries.
